DTH stands for Direct-To-Home television. DTH is defined as the reception of satellite programs with a personal dish in an individual home. DTH does away with the need for the local cable operator and puts the broadcaster directly in touch with the consumer. Only cable operators can receive satellite programs and they then distribute them to individual homes.
